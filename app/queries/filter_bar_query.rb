# This implements an efficient query for MetaData in the DynamicFilters presenter
# Takes an (ActiveRecord) `Scope` and a list of `Context` IDs.
# Returns for each `Context` a list of the MetaKeys "used" in `Scope`,
# and for each MetaKey a list of the "used" Values,
# along with and sorted by "usage count".
# - "used" refers to the related MetaData of the Resources in `Scope`
# - "Values" can be Keywords and People
#
# NOTES:
# - USE WITH CARE - never use this with user input (SQL injection ðŸ‘»)
# - only returns *publicly visible* data
#   (i.e. does not fully implement Vocabulary.Permissions)
# - does NOT limit anything (worst case in production is currently fast enough)
